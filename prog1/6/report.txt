The final part of this assignment at first seemed to be much less work than Part 5, however it turned out to be the most frustrating. For the record, I didn't finish it fully. The code was all written and I was able to read the file size and flag status of the shared memory object, however I was getting segmentation faults when trying to access the content of the data. After much research and debugging, I'm confident that the problem is simply that I'm trying to write a pointer into shared memory but I need to write a static character array. The solution is to use `char content[SIZE]` instead of `char* content` and perform the reading and copying of the content differently. This, however was something that it turned out I did not have time for. Thus, I commented out the code that was causing the segmentation fault when reading from shared memory.
Though I didn't implement the correct means of sharing arrays, I'm confident that I know the approach for next time. It's just a matter of reworking the reading/storing of the array.
