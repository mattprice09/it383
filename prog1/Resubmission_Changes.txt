For the program 1 redo, I made significant improvements despite only losing a small portion of points on parts 5 and 6. 

First off, I fixed all of compilation warnings by adding appropriate flags in makefiles. Previously, I had mistakenly done all testing on my Macbook Pro. This was a shortsight on my part to not test my programs in an actual Linux environment.

Part 5 changes:
	- Fixed !! command
		- I had wrongly assumed that this command was just supposed to display the history. Now it runs the most recent command of the user.

Part 6 changes:
	- Can upload/download binary files now (and also many other file types)
	- Keeps track of source file extensions (.bin, .java, .o, etc) in the upload, stores in struct, and appends the file extension to the download file name.
	- Download file name is now "download_DATE_TIME", where DATE and TIME represent the date and time that the user downloded the file.
	- Removed the SIZE global variable and used sizeof(struct filesharing_struct) instead.
	- For uploading, reads the file's contents in chunks.
	- Downloading uses fwrite() now instead of fprintf()
	- Various other minor changes

Unfixed:
	- You noted that, for part 5, the command "ls -Rl / | more" froze. I didn't have time to implement a fix here, but the issue occurs only for commands that span multiple pages (where you must press Space to go to the next page or Q to exit). Pressing Q in these scenarios doesn't return the user to the shell. This is a fixable issue, it was just prioritized below the above changes.
